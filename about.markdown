## What is our mission?

<!-- Founded in April 2012, under our former name Rails Girls Berlin is the daughter of the **worldwide non-profit organization** [Rails Girls](http://railsgirls.com) that started in Finland. -->
Formerly known as Rails Girls Berlin, we've been offering free programming workshops for women without any background in coding since 2012.

**We want to help to close the gender gap** in IT. Currently less than 20% of computer science majors are women, leaving women to be mostly consumers of technological products instead of creators and makers. Furthermore, it has been found that gender diversity leads to better decision making, increased creativity and enhanced, innovative performances.

We are trying to change the gender imbalance by giving women the **opportunity and a community to start learning** to code. In addition to that we want to empower women to follow their dreams and put their business ideas into reality without a technical co-founder.

## Why did we change our name from Rails Girls Berlin to code curious?

There were a number of reasons, all described in full in [this article](../_posts/2017-10-25-rails-girls-berlin-is-growing-up.md). Briefly, the main reasons for the change were that we wanted to:
- be open towards other technologies and programming languages,
- address women, trans and non-binary people instead of girls,
- highlight a playful aspect of coding.

## Why are so few women in IT?

Due to a **lack of female role models**, women are often prejudiced towards Computer Science as a career as it is commonly **perceived as male dominated, isolated, uncreative and uncommunicative**. In reality, programming demands a lot of creativity as well as good communication skills in order to build a good product.

Furthermore, it is a common **misbelief that being good at Maths is a prerequisite** for learning programming. Due to outdated undergraduate teaching methods that favour competition over cooperation, girls are often less interested in Mathematics. They therefore often show a lower performance at school which keeps them from taking up an IT career later in life.


## How we are trying to solve this problem

**We make coding social** by creating a communicative and cooperative atmosphere around it. Our workshops kick off with an installation get-together and are provided with food that attendees bring along to share.

By teaching women in groups of two, we create an **environment without pressure or competition** which diminishes the fear of asking “stupid” questions.

**We connect women with each other, with mentors / coaches and role models** who have shown that it doesn’t need an academic background in computer science or be good at Maths to become a successful developer.

**We foster continued learning** by encouraging attendees to join project groups after the workshop. These groups are led by experienced developers and stretch over several weeks to months. In addition to that, learners of all levels come together regularly on our “Code & Cake”.


## What do we mean by „women“?

We welcome people who *identify as women* of *any ethnicity and background above the age of 16*. No matter if you’re still in high school, have been working for many years or are staying home to take care of relatives. Diversity matters to us, so if you are not fluent in English, don’t own a laptop, can’t find someone to care of your children during the workshop, please contact us and we will try to find a solution.

## Who we are

Code curious Berlin events are organized by a small group of organisers and a huge group of programmers. Everyone is volunteering for this project, because we believe that women are the future of programming. The overwhelmingly positive feedback we are receiving from our attendees and coaches is convincing us to keep this project going.

**How you can help**  
We are always looking for people to support code curious by either coaching or sponsoring our events or helping us organise them. If you want to get involved, then please drop us a line [contact@codecurious.org](mailto:contact@codecurious.org)
