### What is our mission?

Founded in April 2012, Rails Girls Berlin is the daughter of the worldwide non-profit organization Rails Girls that started in Finland.
We want to help to close the gender gap in IT. Currently less than 20% of computer science majors are female, leaving women to be mostly consumers of technological products instead of creators and makers. Furthermore, it has been found that gender diversity leads to better decision making, increased creativity and enhanced, innovative performances.
We are trying to change the gender imbalance by giving women the opportunity and a community to start learning to code. In addition to that we want to empower women to follow their dreams and put their business ideas into reality without a technical co-founder.

### Why are so few women in IT?

Due to a lack of female role models, women are often prejudiced towards Computer Science as a career as it is commonly perceived as male dominated, isolated, uncreative and uncommunicative. In reality, programming demands a lot of creativity as well as good communication skills in order to build a good product.
Furthermore, it is a common misbelief that being good at Maths is a prerequisite for learning programming. Due to outdated undergraduate teaching methods that favour competition over cooperation, girls are often less interested in Mathematics. They therefore often show a lower performance at school which keeps them from taking up an IT career later in life.

### How we are trying to solve this problem?

We make coding social by creating a communicative and cooperative atmosphere around it. Our workshops kick off with an installation get-together, are provided with food that attendees bring along to share and end with an after-party.
By teaching women in groups of two we create an environment without pressure or competition which diminishes the fear of asking “stupid” questions.
We connect women with each other, with mentors / coaches and role models who have shown that it doesn’t need an academic background in computer science or be good at Maths to become a successful developer.
We foster continued learning by encouraging attendees to join project groups after the workshop. These groups are led by experienced developers and stretch over several weeks to months. In addition to that, larners of all levels come together regularly on our “Code & Cake”.

### What do we mean by „women“ and „girls“?

Although we use „girls“ in our name, we welcome people who *identify as female* of *any age, ethnicity and background*. No matter if you’re still in school, have been working for many years or are staying home to take care of relatives. Diversity matters to us, so if you are not fluent in English, don’t own a laptop, can’t find someone to care of your children during the workshop, please contact us and we will try to find a solution.
