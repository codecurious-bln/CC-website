# Because of current health risks all workshops are canceled!
We are also sad that we cannot give any workshops at the moment and we ask you to understand the current risks of spreading COVID-19. 

## What can I do?
First of all keep yourself up to date concerning all news around the virus. And don't forget to **wash your hands** üñêüèΩ!
Also there are plenty of possibilities to learn coding  **online**. For inspiration you can check out our links [here](/en/links).

## What we do?
Formerly known as *Rails Girls Berlin*, we organize **free coding workshops for women, non-binary and trans people** without prior experience in coding. These workshops are led by skilled programmers who are eager to help newbies and to increase the number of women* in IT. During our workshops, we try to create a cozy space where **questions are welcome** and where there is no pressure nor competition. To accomplish that, we keep the group sizes small and have **one dedicated coach per two or three learners**.
