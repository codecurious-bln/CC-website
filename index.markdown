## What we do?
Formerly known as *Rails Girls Berlin*, we organize **free coding workshops for women, non-binary and trans people** without prior experience in coding. These workshops are led by skilled programmers who are eager to help newbies and to increase the number of women* in IT. During our workshops, we try to create a cozy space where **questions are welcome** and where there is no pressure nor competition. To accomplish that, we keep the group sizes small and have **one dedicated coach per two or three learners**.
