## Let’s dive deeper into Coding ♥️

Whether you’ve been to a Beginners’ Workshop or started programming on your own – if you have a bit of the basics down, this day is for you!

Take these hours to dive deeper into a tutorial, get help on a coding question or continue projects you’ve been working on before.

You can come with your study group, a friend or by yourself; and you can choose to work alone or with others.

We would like to invite you in the morning to quickly share with the others what your plan for the day is, so that they could maybe join in or just be inspired as well. Other than that, the learning is self-organized.

We will simply provide some tutorials / task suggestions, eager-to-help-out coaches and, of course, some cake.

Lunch will not be provided, but you’re very welcome to bring something for your own and/or something to share.

### Get active – start your own study group!

You met many interested women at the beginners’ workshop, but you are all not sure how to continue studying? Maybe you couldn’t find a study group that fits your skill level or calendar? Then starting your own study group might be a good idea! Code&Cake is a great opportunity to connect with other learners and experienced programmers, who might want to become your future coaches! Just ask them.
