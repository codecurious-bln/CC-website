Below is an awesome article that [Cristina](http://twitter.com/crissantamarina) wrote about what knitting and coding have in common and how it feels to be a Rails girl:

Rails Girls is a bunch of women doing code. Some women meet for coffee, some like to go in groups to the hairdresser. There are knitting clubs. Women playing basketball. We like to dig into that cryptic thing - the Programming thing. Note the capitalization. It still feels adventurous to think about it.   

When I was 16, my school organized a visit to the University of Valencia. We were invited to pick one Faculty, and we went to visit the installations, walk around the corridors, look inside the classrooms and enjoy the campus a bit. I never considered myself an IT person, but for some reason I chose the IT Faculty. I don’t remember much of it (as I said, I did not have a particular interest in it by then), but what I do remember is that there were no women. At all.

IT guys are a crowd and I have met some in my life. Neighbors, colleagues, flatmates, lovers and friends. But I had never met an IT woman until last year. Why is this? Are computers _for boys_?

I strongly believe women can be great programmers. And great designers. And great administrators. As good as men can be. _Why_, then, are labs full of guys?

**If you’d ask anyone to describe an IT person, they’d come out with some Michael Moore looking guy, locked in his dark flat and getting a tan from his screen.** I think women don’t even think they _can_ program - what do we have on common with that guy? He was probably dreaming of making his own version of Pong while we played with our Little Pony and getting top marks in maths while we struggled to understand what an inequality was. So we just assume that you need to be cut above the rest if you want to program.

**The truth is you don’t need to be that guy.** Actually, most of the IT men I have met wear nice clothes, go out for drinks and have very active social lifes. Of course that guy exists. You met him in high school, remember? Of course that guy in your last year of school is probably working in some very complex IT project by now, saving a lot of people a lot of time and a lot of money, or making someone rich. But you don’t need to know every single detail or every single language, and you don’t need to quit your Real Life and save the world if you don’t want to; but if you think of little software changes you’d love to make more often than you think of your highlights - you may be one of Them. **And yes, you can still wear skirts if you want to.**

Use Google to find the next Rails Girls event in your city and sign up. If you cant find an event that’s specific for women - I bet men don’t find it a big problem if a girl shows up. If you are shy, or if you live in _one of those places_ far away from any civilization, you can try [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/ "Codecademy") or any of the hundreds of similar tutorials that are now available in the internet.

I am looking forward to hearing more about apps built by women. I am looking forward to nice designs and intuitive interfaces. **Don’t let the gender factor set you back!**
