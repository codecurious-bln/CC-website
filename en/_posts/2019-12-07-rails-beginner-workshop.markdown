6th and 7th December 2019

code curious want to give absolute beginners the opportunity and community to learn the technologies needed to build their own website, with a hands on introduction to a web framework called Ruby on Rails. Attendees will be guided by coaches in building their website.

We provide a unique learning environment to not only support, but also further motivate women who want to code, but don't have the right environment to do so. We are a community, so this is the start of a longer career changing path for many of our attendees.

## Who

The workshop is geared towards women with no coding experience. [**Apply Here**](http://workshops.codecurious.org/events/6/applications/new)
