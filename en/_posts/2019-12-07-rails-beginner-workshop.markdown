### Let's dive into Coding ♥️
code curious wants to give absolute beginners the opportunity and community to learn the technologies needed to build their own website, with a hands-on introduction to a web framework called Ruby on Rails. Attendees will be guided by coaches in building a website using our tutorials.


We provide a unique learning environment to not only support, but also further motivate women* who want to code, but don't have the right environment to do so. We are a community, so this event often is the ignition point for a career change (even if it takes a while) for many of our attendees.
